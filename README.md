# Methods-for-Processing-a-Sequence-of-Numbers
我将会把我学到的，对数字的处理方法放在这里。"I will put the methods I have learned for processing numbers here
在不同的源文件里放了对数字的不同操作eg:第一次提交的两个源文件分别是找个位数出现次数和找每个数字的个位数；
In different source files, I've included different operations on numbers. For example, the first submission consists of two source files: one for counting the occurrences of each digit and one for finding the units place of each number.
